            <article>
                <p>
                    Magic: The Gathering is a trading card game that was created in 1993 by a man named Richard Garfield. 
                    It has the unique distinction of being the first trading card game (TCG) ever created. As of 2015, Magic has roughly 
                    12 million players world-wide. It can be played by two or more players in many different formats which fall into two categories: 
                    Constructed and Limited.  
                </p>

            <h2> Objective </h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                     The goal of Magic: The Gathering is to be the last player standing. 
                     This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, but the most common 
                     way is to reduce your opponent's life from 20 down to 0.
