Proposal:

Lightseekers TCG Site

One of my favorite games is Magic: The Gathering. It's been around for a long time and it has a lot of resources for its players. 
I heard of a new game called Lightseekers that came out some time in the last year. Since it's realtively new, I wanted to see if
I could build a site similar to the ones for Magic that could act as a resource for Lightseekers' players.

I have more information for this site, but I'm not sure what APIs (if any) there are.
