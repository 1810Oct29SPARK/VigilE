                <h4> Summary </h4>
                <p>
                    Preternatural is a Fantasy TV series about an 18-year-old boy named Jason Gray. He's about to start his senior year of high school,
                    but something strange has been going on with him for the past 6 months. He has problems with his vision and he keeps coming 
                    into possession of things that aren't his without knowing how they get there. Everyone at school thinks that Jason 
                    has some sort of drug or alcohol problem and he starts to think that he's going crazy. After visiting a guy named Luke,           
                    he discovers that what he's is experiencing is his Preterhuman Powers manifesting themselves.                      </p>

                <h4> Preterhumans </h4>
                <p>
                    Preterhumans are a race of people with the unique ability to manipulate objects. They have a variety of powers and can 
                    move things with their minds, teleport them from one place to another, create inorganic matter out of thin air,
                    disintegrate it, and transform their bodies into any material(s) they want (to name a few). Their abilities make them                         powerful and dangerous, which is why a secret organization called the World Protection Network (WPN) wants to use 
                    Preterhumans for their own ends. They will stop at nothing to achieve their goals, To protect his family, Jason joins the 
                    Preterhumans to fight for their survival.

            <h3> Inspiration for the Show</h3>
            <article> 
                <h4> Powers </h4>
                <p>
                    I got the inspiration for the powers in this show by going through the Superpower Wiki. All of the abilities are based off of the
                    one listed on the <a href="http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Object_Manipulation"> Object Manipulation</a> page. I looked through all of them, used the ones I liked and re-named some of the powers. 
                    There are some powers that I felt would make Preterhumans overpowered, so I excluded them.

                <h4> Plot </h4>
                <p>
                    The plot of the show is based a bit on a show called The Tomorrow People. In that show, there is a species of people with psychic powers 
                    that are on the run from a secret organization wanting to hunt them down to extinction. Preternatural is very much the same way, but I
                    decided to make it a little different by having the WPN hunt down Preterhumans to exploit them instead of driving them to extinction.
