                                        Jason is an 18-year-old high school student who is struggling to keep his newly-manifested powers under control. 
                                        He has spent the last couple of months believing that he has dissociative identity disorder and that his 
                                        "other half" doing things without him knowing it. Because of his behavior, many of the other students at his school have
                                        ostracized him. After meeting with Luke, he realizes that he isn't crazy and see his new powers as a way to turn his life around.

                                        he is more comfortable being reckless. He's one of the best players on the soccer team. <br>

                                        so she ran to prevent her parents from being caught in the crossfire.
